COMMIE Changelog (add new on top)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jul 6th, 2010 (JFS)
	- commie_compute_normalizaton will now  handle a complete lack of 
	common pixels gracefully.

Jun 9th, 2010 (JFS)
	- ccd_classify now will not assume that average dark current level is 
	below 300 counts.

Feb 23rd, 2010 (JFS)
	- added second mode of flux normalization. If there is not enough 
	common pixels to normalize all arrays to, then each array will be 
	normalized in pairs.

Feb 21st, 2010 (JFS)
	- added possibility to define a subset in the scriptfile using 
	subset_indices
	
Dec 9th, 2009 (JFS)
	- added possibility to not have beamstop subtracted from one or
	more positions.

Feb 22nd (JFS)
	- new script file tag ring_amps. This can be used for top-off mode when 
	ring current should stay the same always. 
	
Feb 20th (JFS)
	- COMMIE can now read files written with the new version 6 of dt_par.
	It will check the version before to decide whether to read up2xstg_m 
	or dnxstg_m.

Nov 23rd (JFS)
	- COMMIE now saves the theta_x angle in the adi struct. For 2D images
	this should be the same for all raw datafiles. For 3D we will use the 
	array structure theta_x_radians in ainfo_struct.

Jun 24th (JFS)
	- added new routine commie_get_motor_positions that will go through the
	sample files and try to determine the motor positions and values
	if nothing has been specified in the scriptfile. It will then call 
	_scriptfile_io with the new keyword /add_motor_positions which will
	write the motor positions to the scriptfile
	
Jun 23rd (JFS)
	- added smoothing to commie_compute_shifts, as this will remove the 
	speckles and yields better results for the alignment
	- added keyword no_smooth_ref to commie_compute_shifts. This will not
	smooth the reference array which is used when aligning to a fake 
	noise and speckle free square.
	- added new routine commie_find_shifts, which is now called by 
	commie_find_pos_shifts in order to minimize code repetition.
	- commie should now prompt when you are about to overwrite an already
	existing assembled file.
	
May 29th (JFS)
	- user now prompted for reference array in commie_find_pos_shifts.
	At some point this should be automated.
	
May 28th (JFS)
	- greater edgegauss sigma seems to be working well.
	- reversed some changes. In particular went back to bs_xs and bs_ys,
	since we need the center position as starting index for growing the 
	beamstop with interactive region grow.
	- absolute beamstop position is determined by looking at 
	cross-correlation with centered square. User is prompted for consent on
	the determined position
	
May 27th (JFS)
	- added automatic alignment of beamstop positions in new routine
	commie_find_pos_shifts.
	- new function commie_compute_shifts that does the math
	- changed tags bs_xs and bs_ys in scriptfile_io to pos_x_shifts and
	pos_y_shifts respectively. 
	- Other changes necessary because of tagname change:
		- _verbose_output
		- _manual_align: no need to determine bs position, removed
		that button, returns relative shifts instead
		- remove_bs
	- there are two independent functions now commie_find_pos_shifts and 
	commie_find_bs_arr.
	
May 16th (JFS)
	- included possibility to patch beamstop mask together in Interactive
	region_grow.
	- updated status-strings in commie_manual_align
	
May 14th (JFS)
	- added new function commie_manual_align which facilitates the 
	alignment of the different positions before finding the beamstop. 
	It will replace display_zoom_click and be optional once the automatic
	alignment works.
	
Apr 25th (JFS)
	- all tags in adi_struct not carried over from dt_par into one of 
	the commie_structs are set to zero.
	
Apr 17th (JFS)
	- added possibility to only look at region of interest to 
	commie_find_bs_widget,pro 
	
Apr 16th (JFS)
	- renamed commie_find_bs to commie_find_bs_pos and commie_find_bs_arr
	- bs position still determined before merge_by_pos but the interactive
	region grow is now loaded after merge_by_pos which has the advantage 
	that we know how the signal is scaling 1/r^3

Apr 7th (JFS)
	- changed dk_saveread_dir to dk_saveread_file to make it more 
	obvious
	- changed save_bs to bs_saveread_file
	- added tagname energy_ev
	
Mar 28th (JFS)
	- fixed bug in _scriptfile_io.
	- it is now possible to not indicate any dark current files in the 
	scriptfile if the info can be loaded from disk
	- accounted for possibility of user handing over only one array to 
	_compute_normalization.
	- removed corner scatter removal code leftovers in _assemble_merged_pos
	- fixed bug in _init_relerrs that required certain dk exposure times
	to initialize relerror arrays for all positions.
	- fixed bug in _saveread_merged_pos related to the filenames with 
	control number
	- _compute_normalization now chooses reference array by looking for 
	the maximum amount of overlapping pixel per given reference array.
	If the number of common pixels is less then 100 then it prints a 
	warning and will not perform flux normalization.
	- changed nomenclature of saved merged pos.
	
Mar 26th (JFS)
	- added default dk_saveread_dir in _get_filenames 
	- deprecated masks-keyword in _get_filenames since it is no longer
	needed
	- added new keyword /no_background that will leave the no_sample un
	subtracted. It required adjustments in the following files: 
	commie.pro, _script_struct__define,_get_filenames, _saveread_merged_pos,
	and _merge_by_pos
	- modifed meaning of keyword /dk_by_pix. If it is not set, both average 
	and rms error are taken from the fitted data. This required changes 
	in the following files: commie.pro, _saveread_dk, ccd_classify,
	and _init_relerrs
	- tested and seems to work
	- _write_adi now also stores no_background, dk_by_pix and merge_first
	- added test for what keywords have been set in earlier merge if user 
	is using previously merged positions with _saveread_merged_pos
	
Mar 24th (JFS)
	- now provided for possibility that the relative errors can be zero in
	input arrays. If that is the case then do not use these pixels in
	_compute_normalization and _weighted_averages
	- fixed bug in _merged_dummy_arrays so that relerror arrays are 
	correctly handed over to commie_dataset_struct

Mar 21st (JFS)
	- fixed bug in ccd_classify. When there are no damaged pixels found we
	need the Reform command to convert it to something that write_bin
	- fixed another bug in ccd_classify. When the input array is 0 we 
	cannot calculate a relative error since this would involve a division 
	by zero. In that case we just leave the relerror to be 0. We might
	need to check in subsequent parts, i.e. in _compute_normalization 
	and _weighted_averages against abs_errors that are 0.

Mar 20th (JFS)
	- added tag mp_saveread_dir where user can specify the directory to 
	store the merged positions to. If nothing is specified, then the topdir
	is used.
	- added Keyword use_saved_merged_pos to commie.pro. If this Keyword is
	set, it will invoke a new routine _saveread_merged_pos that will 
	attempt to read the saved merged positions from disk. If they are not 
	all present it will print a warning and invoke _merge_by_pos. 

Mar 19th (JFS)
	- re-did error calculation if _weighted_averages is invoked. Error of
	mean is directly calculated in that function. This lead to some changes
	in _merge_by_exp, _merge_dummy_arrays, and _assemble_merged_pos
	- error arrays are now saved beyond _assemble_merged_pos and will be 
	stored in final file as adi_error_array in _write_adi
	- normalization is now calculated by only looking at indices that are 
	common to all files that are to be normalized. 
	- Introduced steepness parameter in _intens_scaling. It makes it 
	possible to crank the scaling to be able to get saturated pixels 
	within the BS-head.

Mar 18th (JFS)
	- changed the ev/count constant in _init_relerrs to 23.44 instead of 
	3.63. To be verified with Stefano, David.
	- changed _threshold_data to threshold to 10 sigma instead of 5 

Mar 17th (JFS)
	- added new function _compute_normalization. It is being called by 
	_flux_normalization to compute the normalization constant
	- added new message in _messages that asks user to manually enter 
	wavelength if it is not recorded with the datafiles
	- added automatic thresh_data_factor estimate by having it be 
	1/(lowest ring current). This only kicks in if user didn't specify 
	something in scriptfile.
	- changed _subtract_no_sample to use Where(this_sample) to identify 
	indices where to subtract from instead of for-loop through all indices.
	This should be faster.

Mar 16th (JFS)
	- as it turns out scaling is no longer necessary if using 
	_weighted_averages!! 
	- removed scaling from _remove_saturation,  _threshold_data, 
	and _assemble_merged_pos
	- _init_relerrs is now using where() instead of a for-loop which speeds
	things up

Mar 14th (JFS)
	- all status output now handled by commie_messages

Mar 13th (JFS)
	- added new functions _propagate_errors, _weighted_averages
	- implemented these functions in _merge_by_exp, _subtract_no_sample, 
	_merge_dummy_arrays, and _assemble_merged_pos

Mar 12th (JFS)
	- tested weighted sums for _merge_by_exp
	- tested error propagation through _merge_dummy_arrays
	- implemented error propagation in subtract_no_sample
	- implemented and sort of tested _flux_normalization for 
	_merge_dummy_arrays
	- implemented weighted averages for _merge_dummy_arrays
	- implemented error propagation for _merge_dummy_arrays
	- implemented weighted averages for _assemble_merged_pos

Mar 11th (JFS)
	- added new routine commie_flux_normalization which calculates the 
	normalization constant between the first dummy_array (pos_merged_array)
	and the other dummy_arrays (pos_merged_arrays)
	- added new pointer arrays relerror_samples and relerror_no_samples to
	dataset_struct. They will hold the error arrays after each position 
	has been merged.
	- added commie_flux_normalization to _merge_by_exp, 
	_merge_dummy_arrays, and _assemble_merged_pos
	- tested _flux_normalization for _merge_by_exp
	- implemented weighted averages for _merge_by_exp

Mar 10th (JFS)
	- added new routine commie_init_relerrs.pro which calculates the 
	standard deviations for each pixel of each array in dummy_arrays as 
	the rms-sum of the background/readout and the photon noise
	- the result from above is stored in new pointer-array 
	dummy_relerror_arrays
	- renamed dk_classify to ccd_classify and moved it to /diffmic/idl/util
	- changed _normalize_wrt_current to normalize to 1 Amps instead of a 
	user-defineable number. 
	- removed max_current_amps from all files
	
Mar 6th (JFS)
	- added compile_opt idl2 to commie.pro, dk_classify, dm_despike, 
	and display_zoom_click.pro
	- added compile_opt idl2,hidden to all other routines in folder commie
	
Mar 5th (JFS)
	- added dk_by_pix subtraction to _subtract_dks. If dk_avg_arrays are
	found to be incomplete, user is asked to confirm to user standard 
	subtraction where necessary. Tested and works except for some 
	inconsistencies with the status messages.
	- added keyword /subtract_dks to commie_messages to issue warning 
	message described above
	
Mar 4th (JFS)
	- changed the way damaged_pixels is handed over to commie by 
	dk_classify. Now dk_classify initializes the pointer array and hands 
	it back to commie rather than commie initializing the array and having 
	dk_classify fill in the values. Changed in commie.pro, dk_classify.pro,
	and _initialize_dataset.pro
	- tested rms noise and average calculations in dk_classify.pro, 
	now correct.
	
Mar 3rd (JFS)
	- added dk_read to commie_messages
	- tested and debugged commie_saveread_dk. Routine will now first see if
	all files and tags necessary are present 
	- changed commie.pro so that it skips dk_classify if dk-info has
	already been read-in. It checks for the validity of the dk_rms_arrays 
	pointer.

Feb 28th (JFS)
	- added routine commie_messages that will issue all warning messages.
	- started working on commie_saveread_dk. 
	- removed tags: masks, mask_positions, mask_header, mask_dir from 
	scriptfile_io
	- removed mask_dirs, mask_files, mask_positions from script_struct.
	- removed mask keyword and corresponding code from initialize_dataset
	- removed the following files from the archive: _merge_dks_by_exp, 
	_get_some_stats, _remove_beamstop_classic

Feb 27th (JFS)
	- added tagname dk_saveread_dir to script_struct. Will be used in new 
	routine commie_saveread_dk.pro to save the parameters from dk_classify 
	or to try and read them in from disk. 
	
Feb 26th (JFS)
	- finished transition from size to commie_dataset_struct.nx/ny 
	- changed comment string in _write_adi to display the version number as
	**.**
	- added keyword median_percent to dk_classify that now calls 
	dm_despike.pro to remove outliers	
	- modified dk_classify to hand back structures slow_params, 
	fast_params, slow_by_pix, fast_by_pix, containing all the important 
	parameters.
	- modified dk_classify to always calculate rms-noise for both slow and 
	fast and to return both rms_arrays_by_exp, and exp_seconds in 
	slow_by_pix or fast_by_pix respectively.
	- modified dk_classify to also calculate and hand back dk_arrays_by_exp 
	if the dk_by_pix keyword has been set.
	- modified commie to assign these new parameters to: dk_exp_seconds, 
	dk_rms_arrays, dk_avg_arrays in	dataset_struct, where each structure 
	member consists of two pointers of which the first one points to the 
	fast and the second one to the slow arrays. Dk_rms_arrays and 
	dk_avg_arrays are actually pointer-arrays.

Feb 25th (JFS)
	- fixed issue with beamstop finder due to rotation, should be working 
	now. 
	- Resolved issue of not defined slope for find_bs.pro if two x values 
	returned from display_zoom_click are the same.
	
Feb 22nd (JFS)
	- added keyword dk_by_pix to commie.pro, dk_classify.pro, and 
	_subtract_dks.pro
	- started to implement dk_per_pix
	- changed tolerance to tolerance_meters
	- changed default ouput filename to always contain the sign of the angle
	- added tolerance of +-1/4 degree before user is prompted that not 
	all files have the same angle.
	- added rotate keyword to dataset_struct. Default is 3 which 
	corresponds to 90º cw rotation 
	- implemented rotate in dk_classify, display_zoom_click.pro
	- added new procedure commie_read_dt.pro, that rotates arrays and 
	converts them to Double, so that user does not have to worry about that.
	- implemented commie_read_dt in _initialize_dataset, _find_bs,  
	_merge_by_pos.
	- changed _find_bs_widget to calculate entire bs_array in _region_grow.
	It is rotated 90º ccw to fill-in the wrongly assigned pixels, 
	then it is rotated back again.
	- started replacing size with nx, ny


Feb 20th (JFS)
	- threshold scaling seems to work fairly well now. The scaling 
	function is an exponential
	- changed _subtract_dks such that it uses where to identify all 
	pixels > 0 to subtract the dk instead of 2 For loops. The new way 
	seems faster.

Feb 19th (JFS)
	- implemented scaling in _remove_saturation.pro
	- added default sat_threshold_high for 2k chip to be 45000. It is 
	defined in _initialize_dataset.pro
	- added structure tags nx, ny, n to commie_dataset_struct. They 
	determine the array dimensions and total number of elements. It is 
	determined in _initialize_dataset.pro

Feb 18th (JFS)
	- added check if angles are the same in _initialize_dataset.pro. 
	Prompts for confirmation if not
	- changed filename generator such that angle will be transferred 
	to format F(06.2).
	- continue to working on _region_grow.pro  and _intens_scaling.pro

Feb 16th (JFS)
	- changed saveread_bs.pro so that it will save 0,255 instead of 0,1 
	and convert it back to 0,1 when	the bs is read in.
	- wrote own routine commie_region_grow that allows for changing 
	threshold towards depending on the distance to the center of the 
	diffraction pattern.

Feb 11th (JFS)
	- started to implement automatic alignment using stack_align.pro. 
	This routine has been modified to fit into the commie distribution 
	and renamed to commie_align_bs.pro. It is being tested right now.

Feb 5th (JFS)
	- realized that _find_bs.pro, was only using the position high data 
	since it set all bs_ys positions to 0 which cuts out all FOR-loops
	from line 185 on. So effectively we only looked at data from pos 0 
	added up
	- fixed the above bug and added the possibility that two different
	bs_xs can have the same bs_ys


Feb 4th (JFS)
	- new CCD images have pixels with 0 count rates, need to take into 
	account when plotting log of these images, done so for check of 
	bad_data in _initialize_dataset.pro



Latest Ideas (add new on top)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(JFS)	for documentation go through all routines and explain step by step what
	is happening to sample, no_sample and such,  Routine by routine
